Config
========================

Right now content library IDs => subject semester IDs => learning outcome bank IDs need
to be hardcoded in the files:

 * constants/Item (for subject offering -> the content library)
 * constants/Module (for subject offering -> learning outcomes)
 * stores/User (for the subject offering assessment bank to work with)

The MathJax config url is in constants/AssessmentItem.js
